### This is how I use git

#### My git workflow:

1. Checkout from the repository
   > [create .gitignore file](git/ignoring-files.html)
1. Basic workflow
   > - [I just created a new file - how to add that to staging area?](git/add-file-to-staging.html)
   > - At this time, I keep on coding. And doing many commits - [one every 2 minutes](http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/2013/03/taking-baby-steps/)
   > - [I keep my camp ground clean - git rebase](git/git-rebase.html)
   > - [I want to see history](git/show-me-history.html)
1. Special workflow
   > - [Create a local development branch - feature branch](git/feature-branch.html) 
   > - [My friend created a feature branch - how to fetch that](git/fetch-feature-branch.html)
   > - I need to make a quick fix to fix that one small thing. (stash, checkout -b)
   > - [cherry-pick. I need those fixes to this branch too](git/git-cherry-pick.html)
1. How to use branches
   > - viewing what branches there are available
   > - merging branches
   > - rebasing branches
   > - moving branches
   > - delete branches
1. Sometimes I make mistakes and then I need to:
   > - [fix my commit](git/fixing-commits.html)
   > - [add files to last commit](git/add-files-to-latest-commit.html)
1. Conflicts
1. Fixing branches
1. [Pushing changes to repository](git/push-to-master.html)
   > - never use push -f
